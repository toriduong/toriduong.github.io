    <h3>Point of View</h3>            
         <p>It’s difficult for individuals to remember and document all the places they’ve gone and where they want to go while traveling. Through effective personal categorization, individuals can easily look back at relevant information of these destinations, meaningful memories and experiences.</p>
        <p><strong>Contributions:</strong> I worked in a team of three. My role was to work through the user interaction of the app, develop screens, and come up with the branding and visual guidelines.</p></div></div>

    <h4>User Needs and Storyboarding</h4>

<p><li>need an easy way to keep track of locations they’ve been to or want to go in the future</li>
<br><li>personal and customizable</li></p>
                
         <p>Once we had a perspective on the problem we wanted to tackle, my team drew up storyboards to illustrate the different personas and scenarios in which our app would be used.</p></div></div></div>

    <h4>Rapid Prototyping and Wireframing</h4>

         <p>We then started to rapidly prototype ideas for what the different screens and functions for the app might look like.  We came up with two different prototypes, and chose to develop the one we felt better addressed our point of view.</p></div></div></div>

         <p>We asked our classmates to conduct heuristic evaluations on our paper prototypes. Main insights we received were that global navigation could be improved upon as well as making our icons less ambiguous. We kept this feedback in mind as we started developing low fidelity wireframes for the app.</p></div></div></div>

    <h4>User Testing and Redesign</h4>

         <p>We used Lookback.io for our user testing so we could capture the reactions of our users while keeping track of what they were doing on the app. There were a few breakdowns we noticed when users tried to add a new location:</p>

<p><li>users didn't know they were supposed to include the hashtag when making a new tag </li>
<br><li>user lacked feedback or confirmation after adding new location </li>
<br><li>add location button was obscured by being at the bottom of the page</li>
    <br><li>the <strong>main breakdown</strong> occurred when users were not able to find the location and lists they created </li></p>
                
         <p>We chose to address these issues in our redesign, which involved moving the add button, including a confirmation overlay, moving recently added locations to the top of the home screen, and increasing font size and color contrast.</p></div></div></div>
