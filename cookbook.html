    <h3>Challenge</h3>            
         <p>The most effective way for students to learn is through project based courses. How might we help professors better organize and run their project based course curriculum? How might we incorporate design thinking into these project based courses?</p>

            <p><strong>Role:</strong> UX and Visual Designer</p>

            <p><strong>Skills:</strong> storyboarding, user research, wireframing</p>

    <h4>Background</h4>

<p>Coming into the project, SAP had already done initial research on the problem space. From this, we were able to pinpoint difficulties professors had transitioning to teaching project based courses:
         <ol>
             <br>
             <strong><li>Professors who typically teach lecture based courses take almost 3x the effort to prepare and run project based courses.</li></strong>
             <br>
             <strong><li>Many design resources aren't targeted towards professors, meaning they would have to spend extra time thinking about how they can incorporate these methodologies into their course curriculum. </li></strong>
         </ol></p></div></div></div>

     <div class="flex-container2">
            <div class="flex-item description">    
     <div class="body2">   
    <h4>Solution</h4>

<p>We created <strong>Cookbook</strong>, a collection of teaching "recipes" to help professors teach design-thinking in their project courses. Our belief is that if we give professors the tools and confidence to run design-led project courses, they would be more willing to introduce design methodologies into the classroom. This would benefit students as it would teach them critical skills for when they transition from the classroom to industry.</p>

<p>The core functions and features of the website:

<li><strong>Categorized recipes:</strong> Recipes divided up as classroom management tips, design methodologies, and example courses to make it easy to browse</li>
        <br><li><strong>Accessible resources:</strong> Each recipe provides the necessary resources to get started.</li>
<br><li><strong>Community:</strong> Professors are able to contribute and engage in discussion with other educators.</li>
         </p></div></div></div>

         <h4>Research Methods: Interviewing educators to see how they build their course-curriculums</h4>

         <p>My team seeked to learn the process educators went through when building their course-curriculums. To understand their needs, we used various research methods:
        <ol>
              <br>
            <strong><li>Interviews.</strong> During these interviews, we would ask questions such as their current method for building their course curriculums, how often they updated it, and the struggles they faced looking for new material.</li>
             <br>
         <strong><li>Participatory Design. </strong>Before showing educators paper prototypes of our website he had prepared, we had them go through an activity of drawing their own wireframes and thinking aloud about how they would structure the site and the content they would want to see. </li></strong>
         </ol>
        <br>
             
        <strong>Main takeaways:</strong> 
        <ol>
              <br>
             <li>Educators find pre-made materials and resources such as syllabi, lecture slides, and handouts from other educators useful.</li>
             <br>
             <li>Educators would like to read reflections done by other educators at the end of their course term, and how they would like to improve. </li>
             <br>
             <li>Educators appreciate student feedback and do their best to take it into account when building their curriculum for the next year.</li>
        <br></p>

    <h4>Using storyboards to rapidly prototype ideas</h4>

         <p>At <a href="http://designlab.ucsd.edu/">The Design Lab</a> at UC San Diego, my team had access to professors who were already familiar with the design process and had experience teaching design-led project courses. We used storyboards to map the entire user experience, centering the experience around personas we had created based off of our interviews. We had them walk through our storyboards, which included low fidelity wireframes of the website made in Sketch. We received validation and feedback on the experience and learned about how we could make the process more intuitive and streamlined.</p>
         
    <p>Our final interactive storyboard can be found <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/GA855FSQ2#/screens/178168983">here</a>.</p>

    <h4>Final presentation with stakeholders</h4>

         <p>The Design Lab and SAP team led a 3-day workshop where educators from different state colleges came to participate in design-thinking activities, and shared their experiences with teaching project-based courses. My team presented our project to them and received positive feedback about our product as well as expressed interest about incorporating design-thinking into their classroom.</p>
             
        <p>After the workshop, we handed our designs over to the engineers at SAP to have it developed. The site is still under testing so we are not able to disclose high-fidelity prototypes at the moment.</p>
