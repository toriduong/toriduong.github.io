    <h3>Challenge</h3>            
         <p>The most effective way for students to learn is through project based courses. How might we help professors better organize and run their project based course curriculum? Also, how might we incorporate design thinking into these project based courses?</p>
         
    <h3>Solution</h3>
         <p><a href="http://54.153.57.8/#!/">Cookbook</a>, a collection of teaching "recipes" to help professors teach design-thinking in their project courses. </p>

    <h4>Background</h4>

<p>Coming into the project, SAP had already done some research on the problem space. One of difficulties of introducing design thinking into higher education is that it takes more effort from professors to prepare and run the class throughout. In addition, many of the design resources available aren't targeted towards professors, meaning that they would have to spend extra time thinking about how they can incorporate these methodologies into their course curriculum.</p></div></div></div>

    <h4>User Research and Interviews</h4>

         <p>My team and I approached professors at UC San Diego who were familiar with design thinking but were still looking for ways to improve their course curriculum. Another important stakeholder we interviewed were teaching assistants, because often times they work closely with the professor to figure out how they should run the project courses and present new material to students.</p>
             
        <p>During these interviews, we would ask questions such as their current method for building their course curriculum, how often they update it, and the struggles they face looking for new material. We had prepared paper prototypes that outlined the basic layout and functionalities of what we had in mind for the website. We also had them go through an activity of drawing their own wireframes and thinking aloud about how they would structure the site and the content they would want to see.</p>

    <h4>Storyboards</h4>

         <p>Being a part of <a href="http://designlab.ucsd.edu/">The Design Lab</a> at UC San Diego, my team and I had access to professors who were already familiar with the design process and had experience teaching design-led project courses to students. We had them walkthrough our storyboards, which included low fidelity wireframes of the website, hoping to get validation and feedback on the experience  and learn about how we could make the process more intuitive or streamlined.</p>
         
    <p>Our final interactive storyboard can be found <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/GA855FSQ2#/screens/178168983">here</a>.</p>
