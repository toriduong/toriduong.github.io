         <p>As design thinking is becoming more well known in industry, relevant design skills would be great for students to have. However, teaching the design process is difficult. <strong>How might we help educators better faciliate design-led project courses?</strong></p>

    <h4>Background</h4>

<p>Coming into the project, SAP had already done initial research on the problem space. They found that while professors were interested in learning more about teaching design-led courses, they faced difficulties when transitioning to teaching project based courses:
         <ol>
             <br>
             <strong><li>Professors who typically teach lecture based courses take almost 3x the effort to prepare and run project based courses.</li></strong>
             <br>
             <strong><li>Many design resources aren't targeted towards professors, meaning they would have to spend extra time thinking about how they can incorporate these methodologies into their course curriculum. </li></strong>
         </ol></p></div></div></div>

     <div class="flex-container2">
            <div class="flex-item description">    
     <div class="body2">   
    <h4>Solution</h4>

<p>We created <strong>Cookbook</strong>, a collection of teaching "recipes" to help professors teach design-thinking in their project courses. From our research, it is evident that if we give professors the tools and confidence to run design-led project courses, they would be more willing to introduce design methodologies into the classroom. This would benefit students as it would teach them critical skills for when they transition from the classroom to industry.</p>

         <h4>Research Methods: Interviewing educators to see how they build their course-curriculums</h4>

         <p>My team sought to learn the process educators went through when building their course-curriculums. To understand their needs, we used various research methods:
        <ol>
              <br>
            <strong><li>Interviews.</strong> We asked questions such as their current method for building their course curriculum, how often they update it, and the struggles they faced looking for new material.</li>
             <br>
         <strong><li>Participatory Design. </strong>Before showing educators paper prototypes we had prepared, we had them go draw their own wireframes and think aloud about how they would structure the site and the content they would want to see. </li></strong>
         </ol>
        <br>
             
    <div class="prototypes"><img src="prototype.png"/></div>
        <br>

        <strong>Main takeaways:</strong> 
        <ol>
              <br>
             <li>Educators find pre-made materials and resources such as syllabi, lecture slides, and handouts from other educators useful.</li>
             <br>
             <li>Educators would like to read reflections done by other educators at the end of their course term, and how they would like to improve. </li>
             <br>
             <li>Educators appreciate student feedback and do their best to take it into account when building their curriculum for the next year.</li>
        </p>

    <h4>Using storyboards to rapidly prototype ideas</h4>

         <p>My team used storyboards to map the entire user experience, centering the experience around personas we had created based off of our interviews. We had professors who were already familiar with the design process and had experience teaching design-led project courses walk through our storyboards.</p>
         
    <p>Our final interactive storyboard can be found <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/GA855FSQ2#/screens/178168983">here</a>.</p>

    <h4>Final presentation with stakeholders</h4>

         <p>The Design Lab and SAP team led a 3-day workshop where educators from different state colleges came to participate in design-thinking activities, and shared their experiences with teaching project-based courses. My team presented our project to them and received positive feedback about our product as well as expressed interest about incorporating design-thinking into their classroom.</p>
